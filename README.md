To make this work, you need a GC9A01 display of 240 x 240 pixels,
the tft_eSPI library, and a rotary encoder.
In the tft_eSPI library, save a copy of the user_setup.h file
and replace it with the file in this repository (remember to rename it to user_setup.h).

Wire your display as it is set up in the setup file.
